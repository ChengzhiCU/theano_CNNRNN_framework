In layers.py, additional View layer is added, which is used to flatten the 4D array to 2D.

In order to perform convolution and pooling, additional parameters are added in the class convolution
and pooling.

Batchsize should be dividable by 10000, or it would lead to error during testing.

Run run_*.py file can reproduce the results in the Report.
